Hey everyone, In this repo, I am planning to add the PCB library I have made for some projects in which I was involved, 
Of course, it is not completed, and there are many deficiencies in the components, but if anyone has any schematic and PCB library and is eager to help complete and improve this library I would be thankful :)
